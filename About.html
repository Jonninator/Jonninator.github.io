			My creations are born out of curiosity. I form an interest in a subject, sometimes a physical space, sometimes a perspective, often something related to the wonder and whimsy of things. The idea is then nurtured with pencil and paper to reveal its facets and intricacies.  I begin to play with materials, building prototypes, and finding a medium. This deliberation can result in an artwork which is digital, but most often in physical sculpture and painting. The results are always experimental, absurd, or whimsical. My subject is the natural interactions that make it up our world. We often view the natural world with a mind to exploit it, disregarding how this approach will harm us in the long run. Sometimes we view the world with disinterest, having lost the wonder of a child and an eye for the beauty of the world. My works offer both a stern warning and an invitation to recognize the need to take care of the world around us.
