			my work often comes in the form of a small idea to fill a new medium or space, and flourishes through the continued nurturing of sketches and discussions with those in my circle, until measurements are made, storyboards are drawn and the work to bring the artwork from the page and mind to the stage and world, begins. Though each artwork often has different specific motivations, I often make these artworks as an expression of myself and connecting that internal world of whimsy to the greater world.
