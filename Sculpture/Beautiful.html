<p>Installation</p>
  <p>2022</p>
<p style="font-size:80%">A sculpture that reads 2 different words depending on viewing angle. This was my first real artwork at UofT. It was built poorly of wood 1x1's and kept falling down, but it was the first time I built anything like it. It opened so many doors streached so many creative muscles. to it I owe much of the good times at utsc. Conceptually it was set in the walkway into the valley trail, meant to reflect the beauty and wonder of the place but also the people walking by and reading it.
