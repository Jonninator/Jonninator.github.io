<h3>
	A Phisical Collage Self Portrait
</h3>
<h3 style = "font-size:70%;">
	Essentially this self portrait explored messing around with the percived boundries of gender and what should be seen on whom.<br>
	I don't really care about the labels and will be me; Fluid.
<br>
  The official artist statement for the course:<br><br>
 	Assigned male at birth, known mostly by male pronouns and my assigned name or typical nicknames out of convenience, In my mind <br>
	these are simply the labels that are used in conversation to apply to me. These terms hold no weight over what I wear or how I <br>
	dress, though those things are still restricted by the court of public opinion and my own insecurities when outside of the safety<br>
	of my home. Fluid is the exploration of that fluidity as it ebbs and floods from day to day, and mirror to mirror that I pass by.
